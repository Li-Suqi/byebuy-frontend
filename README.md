# Travel Service Marketplace — Front-End Flexbox Practice

This is a pure front-end project using HTML and CSS (Flexbox). It builds a static prototype of a city-focused Travel Service Marketplace that combines OTA(Online Travel Agency)-style service listings with e‑commerce-style product cards ("Shopping Tourism"). There is no JavaScript logic and no back-end; the goal is to practice layout, semantics, and responsive design.

## Overview
- Purpose: Practice Flexbox to construct real-world page layouts for travel services and retail products.
- Scope: Static pages/components only; interactions are non-functional and data is mocked.
- Audience: Front-end learners focusing on layout systems and CSS architecture.

## What’s Implemented
- Layout: Flexbox containers for headers, navigation, content grids, and footers.
- Cards: Service/product cards with images, titles, prices, and meta info.
- Responsive: Flex wrapping, alignment, and spacing to adapt across screen sizes.
- Typography & Reset: Base styles defined in `css/base.css` (margin/padding reset, fonts, list/link defaults, image alignment, input basics, headings weight).
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML structure and alt text guidelines.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Flexbox for layout (no frameworks or JS)
- No build tools; static assets only

## Flexbox Learning Checklist
- Container: `display: flex`, `flex-wrap`
- Alignment: `justify-content`, `align-items`, `align-content`

## Limitations
- Static prototype only; no dynamic data, booking logic, cart, or payments.
- All data shown is sample content for layout practice.
